=========

A minimal system tray context menu based TV shows updater based on user-specified RSS feed, best suited for Mac OS menubar but is cross platform. Backed by followshows.com and torrentz.com.

How-to:
---------

1. Sign up on [FollowShows](http://followshows.com/) and follow your favourite shows.
2. Set the link to RSS feed from your account in settings of this app.
3. The app will periodically look for new episodes from the feed and update with search results from [Torrentz](http://torrentz.com/)
4. Copy the link for .torrent to clipboard with a single click and use it in your torrent client.
5. Add the download directly to a [Transmission](http://transmissionbt.com/) daemon running locally (enable remote access) or remotely with a single click, you need to add the backend in settings.
